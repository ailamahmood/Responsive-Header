# Responsive-Header
 Creating a responsive header

 Improvements and Explanations:

Fixed Logo Issue:
Error: In the first code, the src attribute of the logo image was empty (<img src="Â  " alt="insurancy-logo" border="0">).
Fix: The second code sets the src attribute to "logo.png" (<img src="logo.png" alt="insurance-logo" width="180" border="0">). Make sure to replace "logo.png" with the actual path to your logo image.

Improved Menu Responsiveness:
Explanation: The second code uses CSS media queries to adjust the menu layout for different screen sizes.
For screens wider than 860px (@media only screen and (min-width: 860px)), the menu is displayed horizontally (flex-direction: row;).
For screens narrower than 860px (@media only screen and (max-width: 860px)), the menu becomes a hamburger menu (display: none;) and a responsive menu is displayed when clicked (display: flex;). The responsive menu uses flex-direction: column; to stack menu items vertically.

Corrected Menu Positioning:
Error: In the first code, there was a conflict between the nav-list styles for desktop and mobile.
Fix: The second code uses media queries to ensure the nav-list is positioned correctly on both desktop and mobile.

Enhanced Hamburger Menu Animation:
Improvement: The second code adds the class vertical to the nav-list element when the hamburger menu is clicked. This class is then removed when the menu is closed. This provides a smoother animation for the menu items.
